A test plugin for experimenting with custom Gutenberg blocks.

== Description ==

If you want to see the streams behind this plugin, go to one of those two places:

https://www.twitch.tv/collections/JftQ1YlKAhXTEQ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8tzSFPLOgU&list=PLXfBe-Bwd1wM7_eeCGZvizGNthkhMoEiV

In order to get your environment up and running, make sure to run 

`npm install`

in the plugin's folder. After that just run 

`npm run watch-react`

to watch the folder assets/jsx/ for changes. As you edit the files in there(or add new files), babel will compile them to browser-ready JS files.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* A change since the previous version.
* Another change.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.0 =
Upgrade notices describe the reason a user should upgrade.  No more than 300 characters.

== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above.  This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

== A brief Markdown Example ==

Ordered list:

Titles are optional, naturally.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
